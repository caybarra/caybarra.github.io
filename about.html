<h3>About the Artist</h3>
	<p>
	<br> I can't remember a time without art. When I was old enough to hold a pencil, <br>
	     I began drawing. I started by drawing my pets and my favorite animals, and <br>
	     eventually grew to appreciate the creativity and originality of tattoo art. <br>
	     As time passed, I stepped away from art and focused more on traditional <br>
	     studies such as science and technology and would only draw as time allowed. <br>
	     I am now finding balance in life that allows me to pursue my other interests as <br>
	     well as exploring my artistic abilities. I understand that creating art is a gift, <br>
	     and I would like to use this gift to bring joy to others.
